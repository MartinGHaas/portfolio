### Technologies Used

#### React: 
I've chosen React for this project because it's my favourite library for developing web applications.  
It was also chosen because of the new version that's coming: `React 19v` with a new React code compiler,  
which will make the app faster and more memory efficient.

#### react-router-dom:
You may think `"Why is this guy still using react-router-dom instead of Next.js?"` ü§î  
  
**And I must say, 'It is a good question'** \ but the recent news about the merge of Remix and react-router-dom got  
me interested in the future performance benefits of this stack! I'm really optimistic about the future of this two together!  
##### If you don't know about this, you can read about it [here](https://remix.run/blog/merging-remix-and-react-router).

#### Tailwind
In one of my latest OpenSource projects, I changed from scss to StyleX because I thought Tailwind was a bad idea.  
Actually, I was wrong; Tailwind is still the best option for styling a frontend application! It's easy, manageable and really fast!

#### Redux
Redux is one of the best state managers for a web application, and Redux Toolkit makes it easy to manipulate. Very good üòÄüëç
